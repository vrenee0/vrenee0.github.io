## Academic involvement

I am an active member of the LSU Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE), a student run organization that supports students in STEM through technical, professional, and social development.

Through SASE, I participate in annual hackathons, networking events, and technical workshops focused on building practical skills. These include sessions on resume development, GitHub portfolio building, Python programming, and mock interviews to prepare for internship and job opportunities.

Being involved in SASE has allowed me to strengthen both my technical abilities and professional confidence while connecting with peers who share similar interests in technology and innovation.

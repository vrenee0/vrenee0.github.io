## About Me

I’m a third-year Computer Science student at Louisiana State University with a concentration in Data Science and Analytics. I’m passionate about exploring how data and machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems and improve everyday life. From predictive models to intelligent systems, I’m especially interested in how machine learning can drive smarter decisions and create meaningful impact.  

Beyond academics, I enjoy being actively involved in campus life. I participate in club activities and social events, where I connect with others who share similar interests in technology, innovation, and continuous growth. I value collaboration, curiosity, and learning from different perspectives.  

I’m always eager to expand my knowledge, take on new challenges, and grow both technically and personally. Whether it’s building projects, exploring new technologies, or engaging with the tech community, I love learning and pushing myself to improve.  


<!-- You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
